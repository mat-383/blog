# My Favourite Games

Whenever someone asks me what kind of games I play, I always forget and that's so frustrating. I wrote this list so we both know the answer to that question.

If a game makes it onto this list, that means it *really* left an impression on me and I would die for the developers of said game. These are not in any particular order and I don't (yet) have a #1 favourite game.
