# About me

{{< img src="/images/about/the-thinker.jpg" width="250px" class="aboutmeimg _1" alt="Picture of Matt thinking">}}

Imagine a kid called Matt who comes up with a wack username to use online and never changes it. Then they grow up and buy a domain named after it. They are also obsessed with the colour green.

Surprise, I am that person. There is no saving me.

I'm a 22 year old guy who yearns to be passionate about stuff. I was born in Hungary and I moved to Australia with my family at a young age, where I still live.

### Personality

I'm a bit of an introvert, but my friends say I'm the most extroverted person in our groups.

I see myself as a guy who tries to be calm, witty, and weird, but I often fall over myself and just end up being weird. In recent times, I've noted that I am quite prone to clumsiness. I don't like that and I'm trying to better myself. I'm sorry if I meet you in person and I'm dry or difficult to talk to.

### Values

I appreciate time spent outdoors and touching grass, but at the same time I've been interested in computers since I was allowed to use mum's laptop as a kid. Almost all of my hobbies and skills are digital so I'm locked in tight.

Like the next guy, I dislike the power big companies have over society and the fact that they've been exerting it for their own benefit rather than that of the population.

### Favourite Things

#### Games

I have so many that I'm gonna write an entire page just for this one, coming soon ;)

#### Music

Drum and bass seems to be my favourite genre, and all the genres surrounding that are cool with me too. I'll assemble some of my fav playlists soon.

I also keep a big library of my favourite game soundtracks. I listen to tracks from them depending on my mood to relive the feelings I experienced when playing those games.

#### Foods

I eat food for sustenance lol. If it tastes good, that's a bonus.
