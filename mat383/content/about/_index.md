# About me

Imagine a kid called Matt who comes up with a wack username to use online and never changes it. Then they grow up and buy a domain named after it. They are also obsessed with the colour green.

Surprise, I am that person. There is no going back for me.

## Contact

I'm always open for a chat, shoot me a message on any of these platforms. Even if you're just bored. Heck, *especially* if you're bored.
