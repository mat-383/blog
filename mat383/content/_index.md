<p style="font-size:20px;">Howdy, I'm <a href="/now"><em class="green">Matt</em></a>. I also go by Mat383 or just Mat.</p>

<p class="p-note">I'm an amateur programmer who's currently exploring his hobbies. I started this website to document and share my journey.</p>

I'll write more about myself in this page when I've gotten used to this whole personal website thing. It's still in development, so keep watching this space!

**Just finished messed around with the backend, lemme know if anything's broken.**
