This is a 3D environment I made for a uni assignment. I made all of the assets myself in Blender (some textures like the sand and skybox were outsourced) and assembled the scene in Godot.

The art style is meant to be low-poly, fantasy, and cartoony. It was inspired by old Nintendo 3DS games, specifically Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon.

This is actually my second attempt at this art style. My first one was smaller in scale and took place a year prior. Here it is:

<div class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper"> <iframe title="Low-poly Fantasy Farmhouse" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking" xr-spatial-tracking execution-while-out-of-viewport execution-while-not-rendered web-share src="https://sketchfab.com/models/5d1e5958e6bc4e409f601028557860b4/embed?dnt=1" style="max-width:550px; width:100%; aspect-ratio: 1.5; max-height: 275px; margin:32px auto; display:block; box-shadow:0px 0px 35px rgba(150, 150, 255, 0.6);";> </iframe> </div>

The world this environment is set in is the world of the dream game I talked about [in my first post](http://mat383.com/blog/building-this-website/#:~:text=About%20two%20years,it%20for%20months.). While that game is *many* years away from being even started and it wouldn't even be a 3D game, it's nice to get the ball rolling with some world-building.

Here is the description (lore) of the scene:

<dd>

*This is set in a fantasy, non-human, species-diverse world. The inhabitants are not very technologically advanced but still have homes, cultures, partake in agriculture, and cooperate with each other in a civilised way.*

*These two naturally-formed islands are largely uninhabited, apart from the water and airborne animals who can easily access it. Those who do often hang around or camp at these islands, usually playing on the smaller western island during the day and finding shelter on the larger eastern island at night.*

*Everyone who knows of these islands agrees to not settle there to preserve the natural beauty of it. Therefore you will not find any developments here, other than the occasional campfire, tree swing, or temporary shelter.*

*At the peak of the mountain is a statue dedicated to the gods that birthed the oceans. It was crafted by the locals to show their appreciation of the higher beings whose gift now supports the lives of many. Since it was built, the crystal atop the statue has started to glow and sparkle, that being proof the gods recognize this offering.*
