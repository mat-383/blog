# Blog
I haven't written much yet, so I'll come up with a better page description later.

<p>You can receive updates to this blog via <a href="/index.xml">RSS <img class="inlineimage" src="/rss-green.svg" style="max-height:1em" alt="RSS Feed" title="Subscribe via RSS for new blog posts!"></a>. <a style="font-size:12px;" href="https://www.autodidacts.io/what-is-rss/">What does that mean?</a></p>
