This is a tiny prototype inspired by [Drive Ahead](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dodreams.driveahead), a mobile game I played when I was a wee little iPad kid. I had heaps of good memories playing that.

I found out it's still being updated and it's become a modern mobile game with microtransactions, ads, battlepasses, and forced internet connectivity :(

As a joke I said we would be remaking it for PC, so I threw this together in about 3 hours.

You can download the game [here](https://mega.nz/folder/G7pDDbjL#66_AfEWzJCFam8SlVI4VkA).
