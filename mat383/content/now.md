# Right now, I am...

Making a massive terrain system for my first big game project, <b>*FAST BALL GAME*</b>. Here is a preview of that:

<video src="/videos/now/terrain-preview-1.mp4" controls preload="metadata" style="box-shadow:0px 0px 35px rgba(200, 200, 255, 0.8); margin-top:30px; margin-bottom: 30px;"></video>

That terrain is not procedurally generated, it is 1:1 scale height data of Queensland, Australia. I'm running it at 1440p on a 3060 Ti with a render distance of roughly 22km (from the middle of the world).

I made a prototype for this game [a while ago](http://localhost:38383/blog/fast-ball-prototype/) and told myself the final game existing hinges on the feasibility of making a massive terrain system like this. I didn't believe it's possible (not at my skill level at least) but HERE IT IS!

I'm super excited to keep developing this. Once I finish enough of the terrain (adding collisions, basic textures, fixing seams) I'll make a full video on this and probably publish a demo project. ETA a few weeks, but knowing me it'll be months.

I also threw together a placeholder of a website for this game at [FASTBALLGAME.com](https://fastballgame.com). It'll become much more of a thing once I establish the identity of this game later.

## And before that, I was...

Editing the video of that game jam I attended a few months ago, here's an image from that.

Haven't edited a video in ages so I'm relearning some things. I wanna get this out of the way ASAP so I can move onto other projects.
