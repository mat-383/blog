# Right now, I am...

Working hard on my uni assignments, all of which are related to game dev :D

Here's one of my experimental game prototypes I made as an assignment. In this one, you insult your enemies through the microphone.

It is just a prototype so it's pretty frustrating to play but you can [get it here](https://mega.nz/file/TodxVJrA#hqgzlyt8QB57RuJxmetHqaDuhZDHHG5lbo8P93HLTGU). All the voice transcription is done offline, so don't worry about that. There will be more of these experimental prototypes later [(my live journal)](https://v3.pebblepad.com.au/spa/#/public/4jbrj5Mn6wsdGx4qztWhfmZGHr) and I'll make a post talking about them too. 

And because of that, I'm not gonna be able to finish that platformer game for a while (*cries*).

## And before that, I was...

About to continue working on the platformer game that I [recently started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yiM-IhRL6A).

I'm pretty happy with how that video turned out and the blog post too.
