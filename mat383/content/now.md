# Right now, I am...

Editing the video of that game jam I attended a few months ago, here's an image from that.

Haven't edited a video in ages so I'm relearning some things. I wanna get this out of the way ASAP so I can move onto other projects.

## And before that, I was...

Cleaning up everything after finishing my last semester of uni.

I have a good handful of projects in my backlog that I must finish. I recorded a video of a cool game jam I attended a few months ago, that footage still needs to be edited. I'm halfway through finishing that [platformer game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yiM-IhRL6A) too, that would be next.

After all that, I'd like to work on making a proper game out of this prototype I developed during the semester. It's an experimental lil thing based on the core mechanic of [Haste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796470/HASTE_Broken_Worlds/). I have big ideas for this, but I'm currently unsure if they're possible in Godot.
