# Right now, I am...

Cleaning up everything after finishing my last semester of uni.

I have a good handful of projects in my backlog that I must finish. I recorded a video of a cool game jam I attended a few months ago, that footage still needs to be edited. I'm halfway through finishing that [platformer game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yiM-IhRL6A) too, that would be next.

After all that, I'd like to work on making a proper game out of this prototype I developed during the semester. It's an experimental lil thing based on the core mechanic of [Haste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796470/HASTE_Broken_Worlds/). I have big ideas for this, but I'm currently unsure if they're possible in Godot.

## And before that, I was...

Working hard on my uni assignments, all of which are related to game dev :D

Here's one of my experimental game prototypes I made as an assignment. In this one, you insult your enemies through the microphone.

It is just a prototype so it's pretty frustrating to play but you can [get it here](https://mega.nz/file/TodxVJrA#hqgzlyt8QB57RuJxmetHqaDuhZDHHG5lbo8P93HLTGU). All the voice transcription is done offline, so don't worry about that. There will be more of these experimental prototypes later [(my live journal)](https://v3.pebblepad.com.au/spa/#/public/4jbrj5Mn6wsdGx4qztWhfmZGHr) and I'll make a post talking about them too. 

And because of that, I'm not gonna be able to finish that platformer game for a while (*cries*).
