# Mat383.com Hugo Project
This repository contains the source code for [my website](https://mat383.com), which uses the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/).

The static built files are [also in a repository](https://github.com/mat-383/mat383.github.io).
## Pre-requisites
Install the Hugo binary: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo
## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mat-383/blog.git
cd blog/mat383
# Run the Hugo server at localhost:38383 to see local changes live
./server.sh
# or build the website to the mat383/public directory
hugo
```
## Credit
I copied files from Luke Smith's minimal [Lugo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo) theme directly into the directories of this website, thanks for that.
