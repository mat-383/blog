# Mat383.com Hugo Project
This repository contains the source code for [my website](https://mat383.com), which uses the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/).
The static built files are [also in a repository](https://github.com/mat-383/mat383.github.io).
## Theme
I copied files from Luke Smith's minimal [Lugo](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo) theme directly into the directories of this website, thanks for that.
